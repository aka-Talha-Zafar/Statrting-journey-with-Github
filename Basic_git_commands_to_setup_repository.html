    <h1>Common git comands to perform basic/usefull functions on github repository</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Cloning a repository</h2>
    <p>
        <b>The very first and most important step is to cloning a repository to your local storage on which you want to perform changes. This can be done by executing sigle line or simple command:</b>
        <br>
        git clone http_address_of_repo_you_want_to_clone
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Git Configurations: (Configuring git with username and email)</h2>
    <p>
        <b>To configure your name and gmail account with github repository run following commands on terminal after cloning the repository:</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>For user Name</b>
        <br>
        git config --global user.name "Your github user name here"
        <br>
        <b>For email</b>>
        <br>
        git config --global user.email "Your email address asociated to github"
        <br>
        <b>Now to see  all configurations use command</b>
        <br>
        git config --list
        <br>
        <b>To see only the user name and email only use</b>
        <br>
        git config --global user.name
        <br>
        git config --global user.emai
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Git status</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Git status command tells us about the present status of repository or code. Tells wether the code/repo is up to date or need any changes to be merged</b>
        <br>
        git status
        <br>
        There are four types of status in Git:
        <br>
        <b>1) Untracked</b> (Any new file created that does not tracked by git yet.If you made any changes to this file it will still remains untracked not modified as this file is not tracked by git)
        <br>
        <b>2) Modified</b> (Shows that you have made any change in file which is not added/committed yet.)
        <br>
        <b>3) Staged</b> (Shows that file is ready to be committed. Means the changes you have made to file are added and now ready to be committed)
        <br>
        <b>4) Unchanged</b> (Means there is not any change made to file yet, everything is up to dated)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Add & Commit</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Git add:</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Git add is used to add new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> Git staging area acts as a middle ground between your working directory and your Git repository.This is where you tell Git, "I want to include these changes in the next commit."
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Commands for adding files</b>
        <br>
        git add "file name" (Used to add single or sepecific file at a time)
        <br>
        git add . (Used to add all updated files at once)
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Commit:</b>
        <br>
        Once you have add changes of files it is not updated yet, we use git commit command to update files or to save changes.It is like the snapshot or record of changes you have made yet.
        <br>
        <b>Command = </b>git commit -m "Description of changes/Usefull Message"
